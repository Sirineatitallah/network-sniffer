🔐 Excited to share my progress at CodeAlpha in the Cybersecurity Internship! 🚀

Just completed the first task - building a Basic Network Sniffer in Python. 🐍 This project allowed me to delve into the intricacies of network traffic, understanding how data flows, and the structure of network packets. 🌐💻

Key takeaways:
👉 Analyzing Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers
👉 Gaining insights into packet structures
👉 Enhancing my understanding of network protocols

Grateful for the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to hands-on tasks. Looking forward to more challenges and learning experiences ahead! 🚀🔒
